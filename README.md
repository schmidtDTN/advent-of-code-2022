# 2022 Advent of Code
My plan this year for advent of code is to quickly knock out a working, good-enough, incredibly unpolished and ugly solution in Python, just to figure out the approach and get a score on the leaderboard - but then, I want to get a solution in [APL](https://tryapl.org/)  working after the fact.
Expect pretty rocky Python and pretty delayed APL in here :)
